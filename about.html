        <p>Adrienne enjoys long walks on the beach, smooth jazz, and dining by the soft glow of Nexflix from my laptop. If sarcasm was a sport I would be the coach, and my impeccable use of the proper there/their/they're is awe-inspiring. I was in the Navy for five years, where I learned the human body can run off of less than three hours of sleep, caffiene is a food group, and iBuprofen fixes all of your problems.</p>
